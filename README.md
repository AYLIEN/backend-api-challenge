# Backend Engineer Challenge

Hello, 

Thank you for taking the time to complete this challenge. The goal here is to get a sense of your API design and implementation skills. This challenge does not aim at finding the perfect solution but rather to help us understand the depth of your knowledge in implementing APIs. We suggest spending up to 4 hours on this task.

We wish you all the best and good luck!
